There is no internationally comparable data on all aspects of this indicator; however, there is a report of the Ministry of Welfare’s action group from 2015 and a survey on the work of family members of disabled people. According to the report, unpaid men’s work amounts to 9 hours. per week and women’s to 13.5 hours per week.
