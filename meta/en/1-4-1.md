Icelandic law also ensures access for all inhabitants to healthcare, mobility and education. 

Therefore, all inhabitants that live in some kind of housholds have access to basic services. However, the homeless population may not have access to all these basic services. According to the 2011 census 0.2% of the icelandic population were either primary or secondary homeless.

Thus, 99.8% of the population live in households with access to basic services.
