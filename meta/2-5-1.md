  The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (ex situ in gene banks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm. The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.
  Plant genetic resources - The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an ‘accession’ is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a gene bank. <a  href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/">Gene bank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</a> set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its  <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf">Fourteenth Regular Session</a>.

The data for this indicator comes from the Icelandic Genetic Resource Council

Plant genetic material is perserved in the NordGen seedbank. A total of 12 plant species are preserved of 352 varieties, mostly grass species but also Lyme, Turnips and Barley. Furhtermore tvo species are preserved as clones, 2 varieties of potatoes and 7 varieties of rhubarb.

A total of 8 animal genetic resources are preserved: Cattle, 2 varieties of Sheep, Horses, Goats, Hens and Dogs.
