  Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse.
computation_calculations: Number of women and girls subjected to sexual violence in their given group / total population of women and girls (aged 15 and over) in their given group * 100. 
comments_limitations: This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop Icelandic data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
